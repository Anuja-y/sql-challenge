# sql-challenge

Please see attached my code which has all functionalities as per the requirement. It prints correct results as per the requirement. There are two separate sql files and ERD as below:
1. table_schemata.sql (create tables)
2. queries.sql (to answer all questions)
3. copy of ERD

I have referred to various sources including and not limited to youtube, class notes and askBCS to understand various concepts that I was struggling with and then implimented it in the code.

Please let me know if you need further info.
